# Base

Welcome to the nitty-gritty, itty-bitty components. These components should be the smallest building blocks, which (in most cases!) don't have any dependencies on other components. By altering these components, we can cause large ripples throughout the application, since they're re-used in most of our templates.

## Examples of base components

- Button
- Link
