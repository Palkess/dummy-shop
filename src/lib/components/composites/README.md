# Composites

Here you'll find components that are built with dependencies on other components and are designed with a clear purpose or context. Composites shouldn't contain too much logic or data manipulation on their own. If that's the case, please consider placing your component in the `/apps` directory instead.

## Examples of composite components

- Search bar with a submit button
- Navigation bar
- Testimonial card
- Hero
