# Components

Here you'll find the components used throughout the application.

## Structure

The file structure is inspired by the [atomic design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#the-atomic-design-methodology), which aims to help us assign a meta context to our components, break them down into their smallest parts, and make it easier to organise our Svelte files. But instead of following the abstract definitions of _atoms_, _molecules_, _organisms_ etc., I decided to organise the components in **base**, **composites** and **apps**. Read about the context under each directory's README.
